# Config

Config is a central contract for NUTS Platform configurations. Currently, it can be only updated by NUTS Platform admins. A more community-driven solution might come in the future release.

Config provides the following configurations:

* Address of Wrapper ETH token
* Address of Escrow Factory
* Address of NUTS token
* Amount of NUTS token to deposit when a new instrument is activated
* The list of Instrument Manager Factories which could be use to create new instrument domain.
