# Project Definition

The project consists of two sub-projects: The NUTS project and the ACoconut project.

The NUTS project aims to build a set of Ethereum protocols that:

* Enable Sellers to create specific issuances using the financial instruments provided by FSP;
* Enable Buyers to engage the financial issuance created by Sellers.

The ACoconut project aims to implement the following financial instruments using the NUTS protocol:

* Loan contract
* Lock-up contract
* PIPE contract
* ESOP contract
