# Background

The NUTS Technology Platform is designed to enable the issuance of non-standardized financial contracts traded through a peer-to-peer network. At the early stage, NUTS Foundation will serve two distinctive roles in the project:

* NUTS Foundation: A non-profit organization that focuses on enabling a decentralized financial system by building open technology to support Financial Service Providers \(FSPs\) to underwrite and manage financial instruments on the blockchain; 
* ACoconut: A Financial Service Provider that underwrites financial instruments using the development toolkits and NUTS Technology Platform developed by NUTS Foundation. ACoconut is a specialized FSP focused on servicing Blockchain Foundations by integrating traditional corporate financial management strategies into smart contracts. The initial development toolkit will consist of financial instrument templates and instrument underwriting guidelines.
