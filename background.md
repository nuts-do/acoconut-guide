# Background

The NUTS protocol is designed to support the issuance of non-standardized financial contracts traded through an over-the-counter network. At the early stage, NUTS Foundation will serve two distinctive roles in the project:

* NUTS Foundation: A non-profit organization that aims to enable a decentralized financial market by supporting Financial Service Providers \(FSPs\) to underwrite and manage financial instruments using the NUTS protocol; 
* ACoconut: A Financial Service Provider that underwrites financial instruments using the development toolkits and NUTS protocol introduced by NUTS Foundation. ACoconut is a specialized FSP focused on servicing Blockchain Foundations by integrating traditional corporate financial management strategies into smart contracts. The initial development toolkit will consist of financial instrument templates and instrument development guidelines.
