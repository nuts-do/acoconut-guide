# Principles

NUTS Platform is designed with the vision to empower non-technical savvy teams and individuals to build and participate in the open finance ecosystem. 

Our approach to realizing such vision is through enabling Financial Service Providers \(FSPs\) to   effectively organize and facilitate exchange markets between Makers and Takers. Corresponding to our domain model, the functions of FSPs can be categorized into two levels: 

#### Instrument level

* Underwrite financial instruments
  * Define the attributes and exchange mechanism of a financial instrument
* Manage the status life cycle of financial instruments
* Organize an exchange market between Makers and Takers

#### â€ŒIssuance level

* Access control for participating Makers
* Serve as credit guarantor for Makers and/or Takers
* Provide financing options
* Provide fiat on/off ramp channels
