# Opportunity

As decentralized finance protocols vow to address legacy problems found in many existing financial services workflows, namely; lack of transparency, counterparty risks and rent-seeking intermediaries.  

Specifically, we believe the overall efficiency for the origination workflow \(such as issuance, distribution and management of financial instruments\) can be greatly improved with the use of distributed ledger technology and consensus trust mechanism combined with game theory economics. 

We envision the opportunity of a decentralized technology framework capable of: 

* Supporting issuances for multiple classes of financial instruments
* Reducing the barriers to entry for traditional financial service providers 
* Compatibility for financial applications with varying degrees of decentralization
