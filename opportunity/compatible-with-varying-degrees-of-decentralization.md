# Customization Compatibility

* Existing DeFi protocols are open, accessible and strives to achieve full degree of decentralization; yet it can be restrictive in terms of how applications can be designed and implemented 
* Take decentralized lending protocols for example; the degree of decentralization is evaluated based on components such as: asset custody, price feed, margin calls trigger mechanism, margin call liquidity, interest rates determination and development 
* Lending applications that are built on top of decentralized protocols are limited to the original settings of the protocol 
  * Example 1: Compound cannot support a peer-to-peer or peer-to-intermediary model, it is currently running on a peer-to-smart contract model
  * Example 2: MakerDAO cannot support an application where loans are originated at LTV ratio of less than 150%   

The motivation in designing a technology framework compatible with varying degrees of customization and decentralization is to allow application builders to integrate full or partial blockchain attributes to any components of their applications.
